# UML_to_code_converter
What if we could fasttrack the software development by building some part of code during the design process itself.
This project aims to do that. We can design a software using the Unified Modelling language, and it automatically builds the skeleton code in the
background. This is similar to the drag and drop feature of the android studio or any IDE which is used for making Graphical user interface.
Whole developemnt will be done in c++.

So feel free to contribute and you can also join me in this project.
